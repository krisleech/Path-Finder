h2. PathFinder


A Rails plugin which extends ActiveRecord using the decorator pattern to allow self-referential models (eg. acts_as_tree) to maintain a textual path representing itself and its ancestors.

This is useful, for example, in association with catch-all routes to allow you to find a record using the URL:

Hierarchy -> Generated Path

# Categories -> /categories
## Books -> /categories/books
### Hardback -> /categories/books/hardback
### Paperback -> /categories/books/paperback
## Websites -> /categories/websites
	
Example URL: http://mywebsite.co.uk/categories/books/hardback
	
_category_controller.rb_

def show
  @category = Category.find_by_path(request.path)
end

_category.rb_

class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_tree
  path_finder :column => 'path', :uid => 'to_param', :deliminator => '/'
end

h2. Notes

The model must respond_to 'children'
